# Statistical-Analysis-with-PYTHON
Python is a powerful tool to perform data analysis, and it provide exclusive resources and pesduo-code for user to employ by only writing a few lines of code.
Howeverm, to really master this tool, we need countless and endless pratice. During my own journey of learning, I often find myself lack of examples to review
from.Thus I crearted this repository to share instances of how I use the python tool to replicate knowledges I learnt from the Mathmatical statistic classes. I 
hope this project could people better understand statistics as a subject and how python could add on the process of learning.
